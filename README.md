My first GitHub repository

Hi fellow bipedal animals,

I am Kevin, an Earth Scientist who learned to code in Fortran during an "Introduction to coding" class as part of my Bachelor. 
I enjoyed it so much that I started following every class related to coding availible in my Bachelors and Masters.
During this period I also came into contact with Python and Mathlab. 

Nowadays I work on Geophysical software written in Object Pascal and have recently started diving into some C++ code.
